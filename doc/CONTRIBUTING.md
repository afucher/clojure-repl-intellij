# Contributing to clojure-repl-intellij

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

If you like the project, but just don’t have time to contribute, that’s fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:

 - Star the project
 - Talk about it on social media
 - Refer this project in your blog posts
 - Mention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues


## Do

 - remember that a gift, while appreciated, is also a burden. We value your input but start with an issue to propose your change before investing your valuable time in a PR.
 - read the [clojure-repl-intellij developing guide](./developing.md).
 - include/update tests for your change.
 - ensure that the Continuous Integration checks pass.
 - feel free to pester the project maintainers about your PR if it hasn't been responded to. Sometimes notifications can be missed.


## Don't

 - include more than one feature or fix in a single PR.
 - include changes unrelated to the purpose of the PR. This includes changing the project version number, adding lines to the .gitignore file, or changing the indentation or formatting.
 - open a new PR if changes are requested. Just push to the same branch and the PR will be updated.
 - overuse vertical whitespace; avoid multiple sequential blank lines.
