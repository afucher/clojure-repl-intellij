# How to use

## Starting the REPL

### Configuration

Create a new Run Configuration of type `Clojure REPL`

![Run Configuration](../images/configuration-add-new.png)

Fill in the host and port of your REPL server. 
Also, check if the selected project is the one you want to use.

![Configuration settings](../images/configuration-settings.png)

### Running

Run the configuration you just created. 

![Run Configuration](../images/configuration-run.png)

A new REPL window should appear, and you should be able to evaluate code in it.
